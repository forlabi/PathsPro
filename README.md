This is a simple web applicaton that helps the user in calculating distances between a central location and multiple remote sites. 
I developed this app as a side project to help eliminate repetitive task on my job.

HOW TO USE
- Input your  the cordinates of your central location
- Prepare an excel file that has three columns [SITE NAME, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE]. Please ensure the columns are correctly spelt else, you might not get your desired result.
- Press the calculate button and a CSV file with an additional column [PATHLENGTH] would be automatically downloaded.
- Yay! and there you go.

- Have fun!
